# hello-world
My Introductory Repository

To start I am new to programming. I am presently learning the swift language as my first language by taking the udemy course by Angela Yu. 
I am a husband to a beautiful amazing woman, and the father to 5 awesome children. 

My goal is to make a career out of the skill of swift programming and maybe even one day some something that is truly worthwhile or that Changs someones life.

I am also looking for someone who knows Swift that would be willing to be a mentor to me and help me along this perilous journey..

that's about all for now.
